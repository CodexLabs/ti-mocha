The goal is to make the modifications to mocha as minimal as possible in order to make maintaining ti-mocha's stability and version parity very easy. It also works well with the browser-compatible version of the [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) assertion library.\r\n\r\nCheck out [mocha's documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download [ti-mocha.js](https://raw.github.com/tonylukasavage/ti-mocha/master/ti-mocha.js).\r\n2. Copy `ti-mocha.js` into your project's `Resources` folder.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// creates the \"mocha\" global necessary to run a test suite anywhere in your app\r\nrequire('ti-mocha');\r\n\r\n// create the test suite\r\ndescribe('ti-mocha', function() {\r\n\r\n\tdescribe('suite 1', function() {\r\n\r\n\t\tit('shows passing tests (fast)', function(){});\r\n\r\n\t\tit('shows passing tests (slow)', function(done){\r\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(done, 1500);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tdescribe('suite 2', function() {\r\n\r\n\t\tit('shows pending tests');\r\n\r\n\t\tit('fails a test', function() {\r\n\t\t\tthrow new Error('this shoud fail');\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\n// run the tests\r\nmocha.run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n1. Install [node.js]().\r\n2. Install [grunt](): `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`\r\n3. `cd ti-mocha && npm install`\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process will generate a new `ti-mocha.js` file based on the files in `src`. See [lib/build.js](lib/build.js) for details of the simple build process.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Issues and Contributing\r\n\r\nDistributed under [MIT License](LICENSE). Please report issues, new features/reporters, or requests in this repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/ti-mocha/issues).\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this is a straight-up, minimal porting effort to make mocha work with Titanium. If you want additional features or functionality in mocha itself, please report them in the [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) repository.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Only tested in iOS/Android simulator on Mac OSX so far. The code should be platform-agnostic, but it would be good to get some testing done on other mobile and host OSes.\r\n* More robust testing for build script, should at least verify the validity of the resulting ti-mocha.js file.\r\n* Testing in Studio. All testing done on CLI so far.\r\n* Improvements to ti-spec output and/or an in-app reporter.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
